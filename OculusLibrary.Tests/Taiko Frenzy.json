The game now features 20 songs playable in all difficulty modes.\n- Progression System: Each song will now earn you XP based on your performance. This XP will allow you to level up in the Taiko Pass. Each level of the Taiko Pass will grant you rewards.\n- Cosmetic Items: We have crafted over 100 equippable items to personalize your gameplay experience with style (stick skins, Taiko colors, Taiko skins, stick charms).\n- The Easy difficulty for all songs has been reworked to provide better progression in difficulty.\n- Game modifiers have been added to allow you, for example, to play your favorite songs without accents or side hits (at the cost of a score reduction).\n- Achievements have been implemented (over 60) to provide you with challenges to reach.\n- The score thresholds for unlocking different medals have been revised for more consistency.\n\nOptimizations\n- A brand new 90Hz mode for Quest 3.\n- Quest 2 optimizations\n- Audio mastering has been redone for all songs to significantly improve sound quality and immersion.\n- New revamped UI for better ergonomics.\n- Optimizations and polish of the environment.\n- Kodama rework with new cool animations in sync with the music.\n- Few bug fixes.\n- Reworked tutorial for better accessibility.\n\nDue to these numerous changes, player saves have been reset, as well as the leaderboards for all Easy difficulties.\n\nAs you can see, this 1.0 release represents the biggest update the game has ever seen, and we hope to continue adding more content in the future. That's why we still need your help to spread the word about the game and talk about it to others.\n\nAs always, we invite you to join the discussion and grow the community on our Discord server:
