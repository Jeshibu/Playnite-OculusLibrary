# Playnite-OculusLibrary

Plugin for Playnite to add support for importing games from the Oculus store.

## Installation ##

In Playnite, go to `main menu > Add-ons > Browse > Libraries` and install from there.
Alternatively, download the latest release zip file and extract to your Playnite/Extensions folder. This method won't notify you of updates from within Playnite though.

## Configuration ##

The plugin should pickup the installation location from the Windows registry and automatically scan for your installed games.
The only settings tweaking needed is if you want to run games via Revive.
